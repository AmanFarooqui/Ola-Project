# Ola Data Analysis Project (SQL and Power-bi)
I have created a  data analysis project for Ola ride bookings using SQL for data querying and Power BI for data visualization. This project showcases my ability to handle large datasets, perform data cleaning, extract insights using SQL, and create a professional dashboard for better decision-making.
## Dataset
 Due to GitHub file size limitations, only the first 1000 rows of the dataset have been uploaded here. However, the full project and analysis were performed on the complete dataset containing more than 8000 rows.
## SQl Questions
