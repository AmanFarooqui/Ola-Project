# üöï Ola Data Analysis Project (SQL and Power-bi)
I have created a  data analysis project for Ola ride bookings using SQL for data querying and Power BI for data visualization. This project showcases my ability to handle large datasets, perform data cleaning, extract insights using SQL, and create a professional dashboard for better decision-making.
## Dataset
 Due to GitHub file size limitations, only the first 1000 rows of the dataset have been uploaded here. However, the full project and analysis were performed on the complete dataset containing more than 8000 rows.<br>
## SQl Questions
 - Retrieve all successful bookings<br>
 - Find the average ride distance for each vehicle type<br>
 - Get the total number of cancelled rides by customers<br>
 - List the top 5 customers who booked the highest number of rides<br>
 - Get the number of rides cancelled by drivers due to personal and car-related issues<br>
 - Find the maximum and minimum driver ratings for Prime Sedan bookings<br>
 - Retrieve all rides where payment was made using UPI<br>
 - Find the average customer rating per vehicle type<br>
 - Calculate the total booking value of rides completed successfully<br>

 ## üìÅ SQL Queries
 - All queries are saved in the [SQL Queries] (./sql) folder
 - Each query addresses a specific business question related to ride data.
## Power-bi Questions
- Ride Volume Over Time<br>
- Booking Status Breakdown<br>
- Top 5 Vehicle Types by Ride Distance<br>
- Average Customer Ratings by Vehicle Type<br>
- Cancelled Rides Reasons<br>
- Revenue by Payment Method<br>
- Top 5 Customers by Total Booking Value<br>
- Ride Distance Distribution Per Day<br>
- Driver Ratings Distribution<br>
- Customer vs. Driver Ratings
## Dashboard
- The dashboard images (screenshots) are available in the main directory of this repository, along with the dataset files.  
You can refer to those images to get a visual understanding of the project output.<br>
